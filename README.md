# Steps to run the app
1. You need to run the backend first, you can clone the repository in the next link: https://github.com/2piradrian/botanist-backend
2. After this, you need to change the API URL in Constants.kt, you can find this file in `java/com/twopiradrian/botanist/core/app/Constants.kt`
3. Remember to expose the port 3333, if you dont do it, the app will crash because android 7+ do not support http request
